Clears (soft-deletes) the media item at the specified path within a media set, making it and all older
media items at that path un-retrievable.

A branch name, branch RID, or view RID may optionally be specified. If none is specified,
the item will be cleared from the default branch. If more than one is specified, an error is thrown.

For transactional media sets, a transaction ID must be provided. The deletion will not be
visible until the transaction is committed.
